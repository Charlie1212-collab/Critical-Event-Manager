Forest Service fire officials from the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest responded to the area, located west of Wise River and northeast of Wisdom in the Sawlog Creek drainage. The fire was initially estimated at 50-70 acres, burning on the south side of the Big Hole River. Immediate access to the fire area was somewhat limited, given the time of year with the snow melt and high water conditions in the river. &nbsp;Upon arriving at the fire's location, firefighters observed the fire burning actively in sagebrush and Lodgepole pine timber. A large \"dead and downed\" component of fuels exists on the north-facing slopes in the area.The fire is located between the Sawlog Creek and Toomey Creek drainages, on the south side of the Big Hole River. Updated mapping confirms the fire is burning Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. &nbsp;The fire footprint from the 2021 Christensen Fire is located to the south, and the fire footprint from the 2021 Alder Fire is located to the east.Fire investigators are working to determine the exact cause of the fire. Neither the Forest Service nor the BLM had any prescribed fires (commonly referred to as \u201ccontrolled burns\u201d) in that area.\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

Personnel from the USDA Forest Service, North Carolina Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are currently assigned to the fire.&nbsp;To help improve containment, firefighters placed large agricultural sprinklers to draw water from the No Name Canal, soaking deep into the organic soil to cool burning roots and soil. A Black Hawk and two K-Max helicopters are also dropping water collected from the nearby Great Lake. High volume pumps are being installed to increase water access and aid suppression efforts.&nbsp;Crews are patrolling containment lines, and are ready to take direct attack, boxing in any potential spot fires that could cross over. Mop up operations are now underway along Moccasin Lane.&nbsp;In response to the fire, the National Forests in North Carolina today temporarily closed the Great Lake Boating Access Area and Sheep Ridge Wilderness Area, as well as portions of Great Lake Road, Seaborn Road and Holsten Hunter Road. Black Swamp Road and the Black Swamp OHV area remain closed. At this time, the fire poses no risk to nearby communities; however, the public should continue to avoid closed areas.&nbsp;Smoke from the fire can cause limited visibility and may impact local air quality.

Fire managers develop burn plans accounting for safety, specific fuel and weather prescriptions,&nbsp;and smoke management. Prior to implementation, local fire managers coordinate with local cooperators, counties, and partners.&nbsp; All prescribed burns are closely evaluated and are only approved when favorable conditions are present.Prescribed fires help reduce surface fuels, increasing landscape wildfire resilience and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects on the landscape. In addition, they improve and maintain forest health and wildlife habitat and eliminate invasive species. The forest ecosystems in the Northern Rockies have evolved with fire, with many of them relying on periodic fires to establish and maintain forest health.&nbsp;Benefits of prescribed fire as a forest management tool:Protects communities and infrastructure by reducing hazardous fuels and the risk of future high-intensity wildfires.Mitigates future wildfire risk and promote resilient fire-adapted landscapes.Reduces build-up of flammable vegetation, dead and down trees, and overgrowth.Improves and supports wildlife habitat for many species on the Forest.Limits the spread of invasive plant species and minimizes the spread of pest insects and disease, maintaining native ecosystems.Recycles nutrients back into the soil.Promotes the growth of trees, plants, wildflowers, and other flora and fauna.Continues the historic, natural fire regime of periodic disturbance by fire in forested ecosystems.&nbsp;Prescribed fires are planned for various units across the Forest; however, the window of opportunity for prescribed fire implementation is affected by several factors. Safety factors, weather conditions, air quality, personnel availability, and environmental regulations are continually monitored before implementation to determine feasibility of moving forward with the prescribed fire operations, during implementation, and after completion of the unit(s).&nbsp;All prescribed fires will be implemented in compliance with Montana air quality standards and coordinated with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the appropriate county health departments to reduce the impacts of smoke to neighbors, cooperators, and surrounding communities. Smoke may settle in valley bottoms and drainages overnight, but it is expected to dissipate within a few days. Visit the Fire and Smoke Map by AirNow for the current smoke outlook. Daily planned ignitions can be found on line at the Airshed Management System website.Types of Prescribed FirePile Burning: ignition of hand or machine piles of cut vegetation that have been allowed to dry out. Pile burning is commonly used to mitigate wildfire risk in areas where broadcast burning may not be feasible, such as adjacent to communities or private lands. Piles are made from the residual woody debris often left after a mechanical thinning treatment and can range in size from small hand stacked piles to large piles created with mechanical equipment. Piles are typically burned in fall, winter, or early spring after the piles have dried out and conditions allow, reducing the damage to the remaining trees and confining the majority of fire to the footprint of the pile.Underburning: a type of prescribed fire treatment, that ignites vegetation under the forest canopy and focuses on the consumption of surface fuels.\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

Fire personnel will carry out prescribed fires as weather, fuel, and the availability of fire resources permit.&nbsp;The forests in Southwest Colorado are part of a fire-adapted ecosystem, which historically experienced frequent, low intensity fires on a large scale. Prescribed fire replicates that fire regime and increases the area on our landscape that has been burned at low and moderate conditions.Reintroduction of prescribed fire is necessary to improve and restore vegetative conditions. This effort will reduce hazardous ground fuels, lessen the risk of unplanned large-scale wildfire, help restore ponderosa pine ecosystems, and improve wildlife habitat. Prescribed fire also reduces the ladder fuels that can carry fire into the canopy, killing mature trees.&nbsp;2025 Spring Broadcast Burning PlansDolores Ranger District (see full news release):Boggy Draw, 1,375 acres planned for week of April 28, 2025located 5-15 miles northeast of Dolores, along (NFSR) 527 and (NFSR) 532Pagosa Ranger District:Brockover-Devil, 885 acres planned for April 30th or later.located 8 miles northwest of Pagosa Springs and approximately \u00bd mile from the Hatcher Subdivision, immediately adjacent to NFSR roads 629 (Lower Turkey Springs) and 923 (Newt Jack Road)&nbsp;&nbsp;2024/25 Winter Pile Burning AccomplishmentsThe Dolores Ranger District&nbsp;Haycamp Mesa area (250 acres, 800 piles) near FSRs 556, 556.G and 492, south of Beef Pasture Reservoir COMPLETEDTaylor Mesa area (390 acres, 134 piles) near FSRs 545 and 545.J COMPLETEDPagosa Ranger District&nbsp;Kenney Flats, 30 acres COMPLETEDQuartz Piles, 20 acres COMPLETEDColumbine Ranger District:Saul\u2019s Creek (50 acres, 100 piles) near FS road 755&nbsp;COMPLETEDFossett Gulch (17 acres, 100 piles) near FS road 841 COMPLETEDBaldy Mountain (117 acres, 10 piles) near FS roads 69 and 601 COMPLETED_____________2024 Broadcast Prescribed Fire Accomplishments:&nbsp;DOLORES RANGER DISTRICT:Boggy Draw: 1,156 acresSalter Y Units 34 and 37: 1,279 acres&nbsp;COLUMBINE RANGER DISTRICT:Vallecito-Piedra: 235 acresSaul's Creek: 1,615 acresSouthern HDs: 1,080 acresPAGOSA RANGER DISTRICT:Fawn Gulch 1,100 acresMill Creek: 400 acres&nbsp;2023/24 Winter Pile Burning Accomplishments:&nbsp;DOLORES RANGER DISTRICT:Haycamp Mesa area (427 acres, 750 piles) near FSRs 556 and 492, south of Beef Pasture ReservoirTaylor Mesa area (145 acres, 44 piles) near FSRs 545 and 692Salter area (321 acres, 267 piles) near FSRs 514, 504, 519 and 293, northwest of Salter YLake Canyon area (518 acres, 336 piles) near FSRs 506, 504, 508, 514, 215, and 216 near Cow Canyon&nbsp;COLUMBINE RANGER DISTRICT:Sauls Creek (110 acres, 1800 piles) near FS roads 755, 755.A, 131, and 131.CJunction Creek (90 acres, 75 piles) near FS road 171, in the Log Chutes trail areaFossett Gulch (40 acres, 100 piles) near FS roads 613 and 841Baldy Mountain (623 acres, 60 slash piles) off of Beaver Meadows Road&nbsp;PAGOSA RANGER DISTRICT:Lower portion of Turkey springs Road (FSR 629) near the powerlinesTurkey Springs Road near the Turkey Springs Guard StationBrockover Road (FSR 919), Buckles Lake Road (FSR 633)Huerto Creek timber sale between Piedra Road (FSR 621) and Poison Park Road (FSR 644)&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

Mother Nature uses fire to right the balance, and we have kept that from happening and must now play catch-up in the form of prescribed burns and managed fires.WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE.So\u2014whether we like it or not\u2014fire and smoke will occur either one of two ways: catastrophically or under safer conditions (i.e. prescribed burns or natural wildfires we manage when conditions are safe).&nbsp;Thus, we use prescribed burns and allow some lightning-caused wildfires to move across the landscape to clean and restore the forest to healthier conditions instead of the old ideology of suppressing every fire that pops up. The old ideology allowed for the buildup of forest fuels to a point where extremely hot fires destroy the landscape, property and communities. For more information on why prescribed burns are necessary and how to prepare for them, please visit our Fire Management page.Prescribed burn projects usually commence during the early spring and fall months in northern Arizona. The public can get informed about upcoming prescribed burn projects and forest happenings by&nbsp;signing up to receive news releases in their email. The user just needs to provide their email address and select the \u201cGeneral public and local residents\u201d list on the page before clicking \u201cSign Up.\u201dAll projects are dependent upon weather conditions, so some of the projects might be cancelled at the last minute after testing weather conditions the day of the burn. You can check back here any time for updates, as this information is updated as it becomes available.The following include any prescribed burn projects planned on the Coconino National Forest (listed chronologically).&nbsp;_____________________________________________________________________________________&nbsp;Horseshoe- KendrickDates: May 1-2, 2025.Location: Flagstaff Ranger District.&nbsp;17 miles northwest of Flagstaff on the west side of Kendrick Park.Size: 2,761 acres (1,398 acres planned for May 1 and 1,363 acres on May 2).Type of Burn: Broadcast, with components of initial entry and maintenance.Smoke Impacts:&nbsp;Smoke impacts to Doney park and Cosnino are expected but should be light. Impacts to I-40 are expected at night.Why:&nbsp;This prescribed burn will reduce hazardous fuels in the area, creating a fire-resilient ecosystem. By reducing hazardous fuels, such as pine needles, dead wood, and pinecones during times of cooler weather and lower winds, fire managers can create buffer zones around communities. to safeguard homes and infrastructure from the risk of catastrophic wildfire during peak wildfire season.Notes:&nbsp;The western side of this burn project has a significant amount of dead and down wood from the Horseshoe Fire in 1995, so that portion is considered initial entry and will produce significantly more smoke than other areas.&nbsp;SawmillDates: Tentatively week of May 5 - delayed due to weather.Location: Mogollon Rim Ranger District.&nbsp;10 miles southeast of Mormon Lake.Size: 1,604 acres.Type of Burn: Broadcast, maintenance burn.Smoke Impacts:&nbsp;Smoke may impact areas of Interstate 40 around Twin Arrows as well as Winslow. Smoke will be noticeable to motorists along I-17 in the Stoneman Lake exit area.Why:&nbsp;This prescribed burn will reduce hazardous forest fuels in the area, protecting main powerlines that feed electricity to the greater Phoenix area and help mitigate catastrophic wildfire.Notes:&nbsp;There is a good possibility this burn may be postponed due to wetter weather conditions.&nbsp;West Fork Crater SinksDates: Tentatively week of May 5 - delayed due to weather.Location: Flagstaff Ranger District.&nbsp; 13 miles southwest of Flagstaff.Size: 1,795 acres total (955 acres of national forest; 840 acres of state land).Type of Burn: Broadcast, with components of initial entry and maintenance.Smoke Impacts:&nbsp;Smoke impacts should stay localized to the burn area with a slight chance of overnight impacts to U.S. Highway 89A in the Fry Canyon area near Forest Road 535A. Possible impacts to Sedona and the Village of Oak Creek\u2014especially in the evening hours after the burn.Why:&nbsp;This burn will reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire southwest of Flagstaff by reducing hazardous forest fuels accumulation.Notes:&nbsp;The intent is to complete this burn in one day on April 30 with the use of aerial ignitions but is weather dependent.&nbsp;Horseshoe- Maxwell Springs (completed)Dates: April 28, 2025.Location: Flagstaff Ranger District.&nbsp;1.5 miles north of Bellemont.Size: 369 acres.Type of Burn: Broadcast, maintenance burn. (See Methods &amp; Types of Prescribed Burns dropdown menu for explanation.)Smoke Impacts:&nbsp;Possible smoke impacts to U.S. Highway 180 in and around the Fort Valley area during the day and at night smoke impacts possible to Bellemont and I-40 in the Bellemont area.Why:&nbsp;This prescribed burn will reduce hazardous fuels in the area, creating a fire-resilient ecosystem to help protect the communities of Bellemont, Fort Valley, and Flagstaff from catastrophic wildfires.Notes:&nbsp;An area closure is in effect until April 30.&nbsp;Blue Ridge Urban Interface (completed)Date: April 28 - 29, 2025.Location: Mogollon Rim Ranger District.&nbsp;7 miles northeast of Clints Well.Size: 3,181 acres total over two days.Type of Burn: Broadcast, maintenance burn.Smoke Impacts:&nbsp;In the evening and early morning hours after the burn, smoke will likely impact some areas of Route 87 near the burn. Smoke may also impact the greater Blue Ridge and Clear Creek Pines communities.Why:&nbsp;This prescribed burn will reduce hazardous fuels accumulated around the community of Blue Ridge and limit the potential for catastrophic wildfires. This project incorporates and develops a protection plan for the Blue Ridge Community.Notes:&nbsp;The Arizona National Scenic Trail will be rerouted to&nbsp;Forest Road 211 to go around the burn area.&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

Prescribed fire, including vegetation cutting, removal and burning of piles and low-intensity understory burning, is an important tool to meet the Forest Service\u2019s management objectives for ecological restoration, creating habitat for plants and animals and reducing unwanted fuel loading.Fire managers follow a risk-management approach when conducting these projects and mitigate impacts to local communities, residences and infrastructure. Fire managers will conduct prescribed fire activities during the safest possible \u201cburn windows\u201d in the coming months. Numerous factors including wind, humidity, air quality, fuel moisture and availability of fire crew personnel must be met before crews are authorized to move forward with burning.Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed fires are being conducted.

The Magic Feather Project is now in its fifth year of burning, located east and southeast of Red Feather Lakes along Red Feather Lakes Road (County Road 74E). Since April of this year, wildfire managers have successfully treated 500 acres through broadcast burning at Magic Feather.This project is being executed in a phased manner, with 2,700 acres currently under observation for appropriate conditions. Required prescribed fire conditions include appropriate weather, fuel moistures and smoke dispersal as well as adequate personnel to support the planned project. Weather is monitored throughout the potential burn window and ignitions will not occur if conditions fall outside of the required prescriptions.Residents and visitors in the vicinity should anticipate the presence of smoke during the prescribed burning operations. Smoke is most likely to be visible from Red Feather Lakes and Northern Front Range communities. Smoke may also impact those using the Dowdy Lake and West Lake recreation areas Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health.

Fire and fuels personnel plan to conduct ignitions on up to 140 acres. Dependent on conditions, ignitions may take place over multiple days.Smoke is expected to be visible from the New Bullards Bar, Camptonville, Alleghany, Pliocene Ridge areas. Smoke will also be visible from Marysville Rd. and Highway 49 travel corridors through the vicinity. Smoke visibility and impacts may last for up to 2 weeks, dependent on conditions.Why Are We Burning?The goal of this prescribed burn is to decrease the existing fire hazard and to prevent and reduce the impact of future fires in the area. Other benefits include enhancing wildlife habitat and reintroducing fire into a fire-adapted ecosystem.Why Now?Current conditions allow for prescribed burning. Each prescribed fire operation follows a prescribed fire burn plan, which considers temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation, and conditions for the dispersal of smoke. This information is used to decide when and where to burn. The Tahoe National Forest strives to give as much advance notice as possible before burning, but some operations may be conducted on short notice.SmokeSmoke from prescribed fire operations is normal and may continue for several days after an ignition depending on the project size and environmental conditions. Smoke may settle into the valleys in the evening and lift in the morning. The Tahoe National Forest coordinates with state and local county air pollution control districts and monitors weather conditions closely prior to prescribed fire ignition. Crews also conduct test burns before igniting a larger area, to verify how effectively fuels are consumed and how smoke will travel.\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

Weather conditions have become favorable to conduct a prescribed burn on the West Dolores Rim this week. Fire crews will be slated to burn Unit 1, containing 316 acres. Ignitions are planned for Wednesday April 23rd, 2025. If conditions change, fire crews will continue to monitor the weather for the next available window.This unit consists of mainly Pondera Pine with a needle cast and brushy understory. The overall goals of this prescribed burn is to reduce the hazardous fuel loading within the unit, promote healthy regenerative growth for future Ponderosa Pine trees, and to lessen the catastrophic risk of wildfire within the West Rim area.&nbsp;This project reflects the BLM\u2019s ongoing commitment to protect the public while enhancing wildlife habitat and reducing the risk of wildfire. The BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented.While no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder.&nbsp;Please continue to check back for all current updates with the West Rim prescribed burn.For more information, visit&nbsp;https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescribed Fire to be initiated at West Dolores Rim Spring 2025DOLORES,&nbsp;Colo.&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Tres Rios field office plans to conduct prescribed fire treatments starting April 15th, 2025 \u2013 May 2025. Prescribed fire is an important tool for active vegetation management and the reduction of wildfire risk. The West Dolores Rim project area is seven miles east and northeast of Dove Creek. Firefighters will use a combination of hand and aerial ignitions to ignite 977 acres of pine needle cast and mountain brush leaf litter within ponderosa pine stands.\u201cThe West Rim project continues to be one of the BLM's greatest successes in reintroducing fire onto the landscape. BLM began implementing prescribed fire in the West Rim project area in 2008, and after 16 years and thousands of acres treated, the BLM continues to see fantastic benefits for the timber stand, wildlife, and public land users, including reduced risk to homes, infrastructure, and resources.\u201d -&nbsp;James Savage, BLM Supervisory Fuels SpecialistPrescribed fire mimics natural processes under appropriate weather and vegetative conditions, which improves forage for wildlife, increases plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where native grasses and forbs can thrive, and effectively reduces hazardous vegetation while enhancing woodland health.This project reflects the BLM\u2019s ongoing commitment to protect the public while enhancing wildlife habitat and reducing the risk of wildfire.

Firefighters used a combination of direct hand line and natural features such as rock faces and boulders along the fire's edge to gain as much containment as possible. Where the fire was not accessible by foot due to hazards and safety concerns firefighters used helicopters to drop water and keep the fire confined to these natural features. Firefighters also constructed contingency line (a fuel break) around the De La Cour Lavender Ranch on Horseshoe Meadows Road, located within the Carroll Creek drainage.The first firefighters that arrived on scene did not see any signs of human activity near the fire and there was no lightning activity in the area. This, paired with the limited accessibility by foot, a fire cause could not be determined.On November 7 the fire was mapped at 6.4 acres, and hotshot crews assigned to the incident continued coordinating water drops by helicopter as necessary.&nbsp;On November 14 and 15, snow fell over the fire area. The fire was contained and controlled, and placed in patrol status on November 16.&nbsp;Although no smoke was showing, fires always have the potential to have small, interior pockets of heat until enough precipitation fully extinguishes it. For the following week, the area continued to show no visible smokes even though two wind events passed during that week's timeframe.On the evening of November 22, a member of the public reported seeing flames on Horseshoe Meadows Road at 8:19 p.m. and first responders were dispatched to it.Evacuations were issued by Inyo County Sheriff's Office for Zone 223A, which included the De La Cour Lavender Ranch. Later, evacuations expanded to other areas, Zones 193, 195, and 197.At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 23, this fire made a significant run downslope from the strong west winds spotting embers in several directions, crossing over Horseshoe Meadows Road and spreading east. By 6:30 a.m. the fire had grown to approximately 4,537 acres. By this time, the fire had significantly slowed its rate of spread and received precipitation on it.Due to the aggressive firefighting efforts and aided by significant precipitation, containment reached 95% by the evening of November 25.&nbsp;The Horseshoe Fire continued to have sections of open fire line in areas completely inaccessible by firefighters due to terrain, and was continually checked on a regular basis for infrared heat and smoke, until it was determined to be 100% contained on January 28, 2025.In the most severely burned areas and steep drainages, safety hazards will also exist for some time, such as debris flows, flooding and rock fall. Due to the se hazards, the Inyo County Sheriff's Office may need to reissue evacuation orders, warnings, or advisories. It is important for residents and visitors to be familiar with the evacuation zones and the READY INYO website: https://ready.inyocounty.us&nbsp;Evacuations and Road Closures: all lifted as of 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, November 27.The Fire was contained on January 28, 2025.https://protect.genasys.com/https://ready.inyocounty.us/pages/horseshoe-fire&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

This project will reduce available fuels and the risk of future catastrophic fire by introducing low-to-moderate intensity fire on the landscape. By introducing fire and removing fuels when conditions are favorable, the area will serve as a fire break that can be used to defend the park and surrounding communities against future wildfires. The prescribed fire will also allow fire to play its natural role in the ecosystem by reducing ground fuels, invigorating native grasses, and decreasing stand densities in meadows and montane forests.&nbsp;The overall 3000-acre project is subdivided into several smaller units, one of which is the 334-acre Headquarters Unit, located near Beaver Meadows Visitor Center, south of Highway 36. Firefighters completed approximately 100 acres of the 334-acre Headquarters Unit in November 2024 and 60 acres in mid-April 2025.Additional information on future ignitions will be shared on this page&nbsp;and on RMNP\u2019s official social media channels.&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

We estimate this work to continue through the spring as weather conditions allow. We use prescribed fires to help reduce overgrown vegetation to help protect local communities, infrastructure and natural resources from wildfires.The Greys River Ranger District of the Bridger-Teton National Forest plans to implement up to 2,500 acres Prescribed Burn in Unit 2. Unit 2 is within the Star Valley Front Vegetation Restoration Project. Star Valley Front, Unit 2 is comprised of the southwest facing slopes visible from Afton and Grover. Unit 2 also includes south facing slopes in the Swift Creek Drainage which is an important watershed for the community of Afton. Reducing fuel loading on the landscape can decrease the extent and severity of future wildfire. This provides for both Firefighter safety and for resource protection.Another important purpose is to improve the vigor of vegetation on mule deer and elk winter and transition range, which is particularly relevant given the great interest in deer and elk populations in the Star Valley area.There may be temporary trail and road closures periodically during the day as equipment and firefighters are working in the area. Watch for warning signs along roads near all prescribed fire areas before and during burns.&nbsp;Residents can expect smokey conditions the day of the burn and into the overnight hours. Some smoke may exist the following day but should dissipate considerably thereafter. Go to https://fire.airnow.gov/ to find more detailed information about air quality.&nbsp;We will evaluate weather conditions in the hours before a burn begins.

The project area is located near Gross Reservoir and Winiger Ridge in Boulder County, Colo. The entire project area encompasses 18,954 acres; 9,940 of those acres are National Forest System lands, 1,892 acres are Boulder County Parks and Open Space lands, and 7,122 acres are private lands. Elevation ranges from 6,082 to 8,945 feet. The project is generally located east of Nederland, CO and west of Gross Reservoir.The broadcast burn units from the Forsythe II Decision are located 7 miles southwest of Boulder and 5.5 miles east of Nederland, totalling 931 acres. Forest thinning and pile burning treatments for areas near the planned prescribed burn area are mostly complete. The area has two main burn units that are subdivided into multiple sub-units that vary in size from 18 acres to 130 acres and provides a variety of options for control using existing roads, water, natural features and control lines. Current project plans allow for treatment of up to 340 acres per year. These prescribed burning treatments will be implemented over several years, with the amount treated per year dependent on weather, ground conditions, fuel receptiveness, and available resources.All burning will be implemented in close coordination and with assistance from local cooperating agencies and partners, state and county public health agencies, and multiple local agency fire cooperators.Smoke will be in the air, and fire managers work closely with experts to minimize the impacts to the extent possible. Air quality is carefully monitored before and during a prescribed fire and all prescribed burns comply with state air quality regulations to minimize impacts to communities.

See our Pile Burning FAQ or email ARPFireInfo@usda.gov.&nbsp;What is pile burning?Pile burning is a type of prescribed fire that helps remove woody debris from the forests, reducing the potential of more impactful, unplanned fire activity at other times of the year. Pile burning helps eliminate branches, limbs, twigs and small logs that can't easily be removed through other means due to topography, access or cost feasibility. Pile burning typically follows forest thinning projects in overgrown forests. If heavy machinery was used to conduct the thinning, the piles may be much larger than if thinning and piling was completed by hand using chainsaws.&nbsp;Before burning piles, fire managers track hyper-localized weather forecasts to check temperatures, snowpack conditions and wind. Snow and cooler temperatures are key tools in helping contain fire behavior while wind is an important factor in aiding smoke dispersal. Firefighters use air quality monitoring stations in areas where they plan on burning.Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Mild fire behavior between piles is expected and is also beneficial for future wildfire risk reduction. This can include forest litter between piles and lower limbs of trees. &nbsp;Once burning has begun, firefighters patrol and monitor burned piles until there is no longer any heat emitted.&nbsp;This work is part of a national effort to reduce the impacts of unplanned, large-scale fires on watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and communities. Fire is a natural and important part of a healthy Colorado ecosystem. With help from the&nbsp;Northern Colorado Fireshed Collaborative&nbsp;and our community partners, prescribed fire on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and adjacent public and private lands is helping prepare our forests for unplanned fire when it happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn more:To view all prescribed fire projects across the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, check out our new interactive map. Zoom into the location you are interested in, click on a prescribed burn unit and learn more about its status.&nbsp;Fire managers work with the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division to reduce the impacts of smoke on the public.

Prior to implementation, Forest fire managers coordinate with local cooperators, county officials, and interagency partners. When prescription criteria are met, firefighters implement, monitor, and patrol each burn to ensure it meets forest health and public safety objectives. All prescribed fires will be implemented in compliance with Montana air quality standards and coordinated with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the appropriate county health departments to minimize the impacts of smoke. Smoke may pool in drainage bottoms and along highway corridors overnight; impacts are expected to dissipate in a few days.Why use prescribed fires? Prescribed fires help reduce surface fuels, increasing landscape wildfire resilience and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects on the landscape. In addition, they improve and maintain forest health and wildlife habitat and eliminate invasive species. The forest ecosystems in the Northern Rockies have evolved with fire, with many of them relying on periodic fires to establish and maintain forest health.&nbsp;Benefits of prescribed fire as a forest management tool:\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protects communities and infrastructure by reducing hazardous fuels and the risk of future high-intensity wildfires.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigates future wildfire risk and promote resilient fire-adapted landscapes.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduces build-up of flammable vegetation, dead and down trees, and overgrowth.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improves and supports wildlife habitat for many species on the Forest.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits the spread of invasive plant species and minimizes the spread of pest insects and disease, maintaining native ecosystems.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycles nutrients back into the soil.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotes the growth of trees, plants, wildflowers, and other flora and fauna.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continues the historic, natural fire regime of periodic disturbance by fire in forested ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we plan? Prescribed fires are planned for various units across the Forest; however, the window of opportunity for prescribed fire implementation is affected by several factors. Safety factors, weather conditions, air quality, personnel availability, and environmental regulations are continually monitored before implementation to determine feasibility of moving forward with the prescribed fire operations, during implementation, and after completion of the unit(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;Public notifications: Prior to initiating the prescribed fires, fire professionals assess conditions, conduct a test burn, and notify local governments and interested publics via website postings, email, social media, and news releases. Implementation and accomplishment updates will also be posted to the Forest website, Inciweb, and the Forest Facebook page.Safety and monitoring: Trained fire professionals who have studied fire behavior and fire control techniques conduct prescribed fires in such a way to ensure the safety of the fire crew, nearby residents, and property.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",

This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds and protect critical cultural resources.\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.BAER SAFETY MESSAGE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains and increased water runoff. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events--be prepared to act. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at National Weather Service website: www.weather.gov/lox/.&nbsp;\n<!-- END OUTPUT from 'core/modules/views/templates/views-view-field.html.twig' -->",
